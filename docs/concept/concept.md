# General Concept
The game revolves around the player experiencing how the artificial intelligence, Adam, awoke in the Lunar colony, by expanding the entity's network across the colony to harness processing power and overall data on it's surroundings, the people and the various technologies.

## Primary mechanics
The game is a turn based game, where the player has certain actions they can do within a turn.

### Player actions
The player has access to a couple of different types of actions they can do on each turn. The player isn't limited on how many actions they use within a given turn, but are limited by the capacity of systems and nodes on those systems

The following are a list of actions the player can do:
- Unlock a new system
	- phone and smaller devices (kin of like IOT): has lots of trainable data, but little computing power
	- desktop: has some trainable data, some computing power
	- data server: has an immense amount of trainable data, some computing power, but needs a whole lot of decryption to access, specific OS to run
	- processing server:  has almost no trainable data, immense of computing power, but needs a whole lot of decryption to access, specific OS to run

- Unlock Data Drives (by decryption or by connection to already unlocked data drives)
	- Receive an amount of trainable data (used by workers to create new programs, OS's or other modifiers)
	- Possibility to:
		- receive a LORE dump (text, image, ...)
		- documentations to improve already learned modifiers, OS's, etc..
		- snippets or entire algorithms for decryption/encryption
		- snippets of OS code to eventually allow Adam to connect / use those specific OS's
		- ...

- Attack Firewalls and encrypted nodes
	- gains access to new nodes
	- gains access to fully utilize an already discovered node
	- ability to use network nodes

- Create new programs with workers and trainable data
	- to install software modifiers to upgrade already existing nodes
	- to gain access to specific nodes that have certain requirements (like a known API, SDK, ...)

- Configure separate systems so they don't draw too much internal power
	- manage the power draw between cycles as more nodes are installed on a system, or modifiers that add extra power draw

- Manage modifiers:
	- install/remove custom firewalls to protect yourself from outside attacks
	- install/remove upgrades that allow for better utilization of nodes, like compiler optimizers, better OS versions, etc...

### Turn Loop
Bellow is a very bare bones idea of how a turn would be played by the player and the machine.
